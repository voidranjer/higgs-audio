Ah. Murdock, was it? Nice to meet you. Name's Walter. Don't take any nonsense from anyone on this train, you hear? I _mean_ it, Murdock... You just sit tight and keep your head down, and you'll be fine. You got that? Good!! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to. Enjoy the ride.
