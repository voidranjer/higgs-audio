[SPEAKER0] Sit down, boy. You’ll answer proper. Murdock’s call stands.

[SPEAKER2] I-I-I don’t like this! What if h-he has something sharp—watch his hands!

[SPEAKER1] Oh dear, Peter, just stay calm. If you’re innocent, you’ve got nothing to fear!

[SPEAKER3] Ooooh, this is better than a novel! Go on, Murdock, check his pockets! Check the coat, the shoes, the hat if he’s got one!

[SPEAKER4] Hurry. If a weapon is present, concealment grows less likely with each second wasted.
