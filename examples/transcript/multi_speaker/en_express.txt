[SPEAKER0] The Higgs Express barrels through the night, steam hissing, wheels clattering. Lanterns sway gently. The smell of coal and brass fills the narrow corridors. A sudden cry echoes down the train. Someone’s been murdered. All eyes turn to you, Murdock.

[SPEAKER3] O-oh dear, oh no, oh goodness…! M-Murdock, someone’s been found in compartment six. Dead! Dead as a doornail! What do we do?!

[SPEAKER1] Calm yourself, Peter. Murdock’s here. They’ll get to the bottom of this. Right, detective?

[SPEAKER2] Oh my gosh, this is so scary! But also kinda thrilling, don’t you think? Like a real mystery novel!

[SPEAKER4] A murder, huh? On this train? Oh, the gossip that’ll stir! I’ve been watching everyone closely. Nothing slips by me.

[SPEAKER5] Enough chatter. If there’s a killer on board, time matters. Murdock, start asking questions. We can’t afford dithering.

[SPEAKER0] The victim lies slumped in their cabin, blood on the polished wood floor. The train roars forward into the dark. Five suspects… one killer. The passengers watch you, waiting.
